            They have been my most favourite languages so far. Though I don't have industrial experience using C/C++, there are many 
            
            projects on my academic portfolio which are covered using knowledge of these languages. Reason I like these languages is that, compared to other 
            
            languages not many functions are in built. That gives an opportunity to write some pieces of code from scratch. Though sometimes it's time 
            
            consuming, they open a door for learning opportunity which allow developers to code more comfortably when they start working with some high level

          Java (4) -

            Java is my second most favourite language. Reason being it gives more flexibility and reduces efforts compared to what I need 
            
            to do with C/C++. I used Java during my graduate school for implementing parallel version of Page Rank algorithm. Reason is that java provided 
            
            excellent parallel application processing library (MPJ) in addition to the fact that some of the APIs of Java are already optimized to work with 
            
            parallel applications.
